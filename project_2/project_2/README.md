# First Project with Spring Boot

This project is part of my personal studies about Spring Boot
and it is based on the Spring Docs, available in: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/.

It is a Restful API created with Java SpringBoot

## To Run
execute the file target/project_2-0.0.1.jar using the command java -jar
or
mvn spring-boot:run
