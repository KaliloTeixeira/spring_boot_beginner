# First Project with Spring Boot

This project is part of my personal studies about Spring Boot
and it is based on the Spring Docs, available in: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/.

Simple application  that uses Spring Data JPA to save objects to and fetch them from a database, all without writing a concrete repository implementation.
